# Shannon-Fano

This repository contains my implementation of Shannon-Fano coding algorithms. 
All data structures and algirithms have been made by me, it was one of the goals when creating this project. STL and its features haven't been used at all.

This is project is a console application which makes full-cycle (coding and decoding) text files. Works with .txt and .bin formats. 

**You can build this project using this command:** `make` when you are in the same directory as the project.

# Basic commands to interact with the programs are:

To start program use just `./program [input.txt] [binary.bin] [output.txt] [rules.txt]` when you are in the same directory as program file.

**[input.txt]** - The extension of file must be .txt;

**[binary.bin]** - The extension of file must be .bin;

**[output.txt]** - The extension of file must be .txt;

**[rules.txt]** The extension of file must be .txt;

You will see such results as **efficiency of coding** and **result of equality input and output files check** after execution of the program.
